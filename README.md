## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

## Running the Application

### Start the Backend Server (Terminal 1)

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
python run.py
```

The backend will start on http://localhost:8000

### Start the Frontend Development Server (Terminal 2)

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

The frontend will start on http://localhost:3000

### Important Note for Local Development

**The frontend is currently configured to use the ngrok URL (`https://57315631503a.ngrok-free.app/`) for API requests.**

If you're running this project **locally**, you need to update all API endpoint URLs in the frontend code from:
```
https://57315631503a.ngrok-free.app/
```
to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

Files that need to be updated:
- `frontend/components/PrescriptionModal.tsx`
- `frontend/components/LocalVideoPlayer.tsx`
- `frontend/app/patient/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/patient/prescriptions/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/patient/diagnostics/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/doctor/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/doctor/patients/page.tsx`

You can use a find-and-replace to change all instances of `https://57315631503a.ngrok-free.app` to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Development

### Backend Development
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python run.py  # Auto-reloads on file changes
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev  # Hot-reloads on file changes
```

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify the backend is running on port 8000

### Frontend Issues
- Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
- Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`
- Ensure backend is running before starting frontend

### CORS Issues
- The backend is configured to accept requests from localhost:3000
- If using different ports, update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `backend/app/core/config.py`

### Pharmacogenomics API Issues
- The system uses EpiRisk MSCS API (https://healthhack-mscs-epirisk.onrender.com)
- If the external API is unavailable, the system will show error messages
- Ensure stable internet connection for genetic analysis features

## Clinical Use Case

This platform addresses two critical healthcare challenges:

1. **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)**: By analyzing pharmacogenomics data, doctors can identify patients at high risk for ADRs before prescribing, preventing potentially dangerous drug-gene interactions.

2. **Healthcare Accessibility**: The 24/7 distance care system enables patients to access medical instructions anytime from home, especially beneficial for:
   - Elderly patients who may forget verbal instructions
   - Patients in rural or remote areas
   - Follow-up care and medication adherence
   - Reducing unnecessary clinic visits

## Security & Privacy

- All patient data is stored locally in the backend
- Video files are securely streamed (not exposed via public URLs)
- Genetic data is processed but not permanently stored
- AI chat conversations are session-based
- HIPAA-compliant architecture (when deployed with proper infrastructure)

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-patient support with authentication
- Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Automated medication adherence tracking
- Pharmacist review workflow
- Mobile app for iOS/Android
- Real-time video consultations
- Multi-language support
